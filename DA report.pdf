Final Project Report  
1. Introduction

1.2       
Project overview 
Malnutrition among children under five remains a serious global health challenge 
that affects both physical and cognitive development. To better understand the scale 
and nature of this issue, this project analyzes global malnutrition trends from 1983 
to 2019, focusing on key indicators such as stunting, wasting, underweight, and 
overweight. 
Using Power BI, the analysis visualizes data from multiple countries categorized by 
income levels low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income as well as special 
classifications like LDC, LLDC, LIFD, and SIDS. The goal is to provide policymakers, 
NGOs, and researchers with an interactive visual tool that helps identify high-burden 
regions and supports targeted interventions. 
Objectives 
• Identify countries with the highest malnutrition burden. 
• Compare malnutrition trends across income groups and global regions 
• Provide actionable insights for policymakers, NGOs, and healthcare organizations. 
• Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that enables visual analysis of 
historical trends and patterns. 
2. Project Initialization and Planning Phase  
2.1. 
Define Problem Statement  
Malnutrition continues to affect millions of children under the age of five globally, 
leading to long-term health, education, and economic consequences. Policymakers 
and organizations often struggle with fragmented interpret 
2.2. 
Project Proposal (Proposed Solution)  
Solution:  Develop a Power BI dashboard that visualizes malnutrition indicators 
across countries and income levels, enabling comparison, trend analysis, and 
data-driven decision-making. 
• Expected Outcomes: 
1. A prioritized list of countries with high malnutrition burden. 
2. Visual insights into stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight trends. 
3. An interactive tool for decision-makers to monitor progress over time.

Completed 
Completed 
1. country-wise averages.csv – Country-level malnutrition metrics. 
2.  malnutrition-estimates.csv – Detailed data on stunting, wasting, underweight, 
overweight for U5 children. 
 Source: Kaggle Global Malnutrition Dataset. 
3.2. Data Quality Report 
•  Checked for missing or inconsistent values. 
• Corrected country names for proper mapping. 
• Cleaned columns: Stunting_%, Wasting_%, Underweight_%, Overweight_%, 
Income_Group. 
• Added calculated column Burden = U5 Population × Stunting_% / 100 for 
country-level impact. 
3.3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing  
•  Computed averages for global and income group comparisons. 
• Verified outliers and ensured consistent formatting for visualizations. 
• Preprocessed data is Power BI ready for dashboards and analysis. 
4. Data Visualization  
4.1. Framing Business Questions  
The Dashboard was designed to answer key analytical questions such as : 
What is the current global average stunting rate among children? 
How do the underweight and wasting rates compare to stunting globe ? 
Which regions or continents have the highest concentration of stunting? 
Which countries have the highest and lowest stunting rates? 
How have stunting trends evolved over time in specific countries? 
Are there regional patterns or clusters of countries with similar malnutrition indicators? 
4.2. Developing Visualizations  
The key visuals are: 
Stunting Rate: 25.81 
Underweight Rate: 13.50 
Wasting Rate: 6.96 
A map showing the global distribution of child stunting. 
A line chart illustrating global trends in child malnutrition from 1983 to 2019. 
A pie chart depicting the income classification by stunting rate. 
5. Dashboard  
5.1. Dashboard Design File  
The interactive Power BI dashboard consists of two main pages: 
1. Global Child Malnutrition Dashboard -  A dashboard displaying various data 
visualizations and metrics related to global child malnutrition, including stunting, 
underweight, and wasting rates. 
2. Child Malnutrition Insights – A data visualization dashboard titled "Child Nutrition 
Insights," displaying various charts and graphs related to child stunting rates by country 
and over time. 
6. Report  
6.1. Story Design File  
Country Data: The dashboard allows users to select a specific country and a year range from 
1983 to 2019 to view data. 
Stunting Rates: A bar chart shows the latest stunting rates by country, with Burundi, Timor
Leste, and Bangladesh having the highest rates. 
Stunting Over Time: A line chart shows the overall sum of stunting over the years, indicating a 
peak around the year 2000. 
Stunting Rate by Country Over Time: Another chart displays the stunting rate over time for a 
selection of countries, showing how rates have changed from 1985 to 2020. 
Global Distribution: A pie chart breaks down the stunting data by country groupings such as 
LDC, LIFD, and LLDC, showing the percentage contribution of each group. 
7. Performance Testing  
7.1 Utilization of Data filters  
Applied interactive filters for Country, Year, and Income Group to dynamically analyze 
changes   across dimensions. 
7.2 No of Visualization 
The final Power BI dashboard includes 12 key visuals:  
World Maps, Line Charts, Area Charts, KPI Cards, and Scatter Plots. 
8. Conclusion/Observation
• Stunting andunderweightprevalence remainhighinlow-incomecountries. •
India, Nigeria, and Pakistan contribute most to global stunting burden.
• Malnutrition is inversely related to income levels.
• Policy interventions needed for Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
• Overweightprevalence rising in upper-middle-income countries, indicating double-burden
malnutrition.
9. Future Scope
• Integrate additional datasets on maternal nutrition, vaccination coverage, and micronutrient
deficiencies.
• Implementpredictive modeling toforecast future malnutrition trends. •
Develop mobile-friendly dashboards for accessibility.
• Combinewithbroaderglobalhealthandsocioeconomicindicators for holistic insights. 10.
